## Repository with course homework a description of the assignment

### Homework №3 Introduction to OOP
This part of the course focuses on object-oriented programming concepts in Java. The code is organized into several packages and classes to demonstrate the following:

- **Car and Employee Classes:** The `Car` class represents a simple car object, and the `Employee` class represents an employee with a car. The `Main` class in the `org.course.hw3` package demonstrates how these classes can be used together.

- **Car Class:** The `Car` class has methods to start and stop the car, as well as display car information. It showcases encapsulation and object-oriented principles.

- **Employee Class:** The `Employee` class represents an employee with properties like name, email, phone, position, and age. It also has an association with the `Car` class.

- **Main Class:** The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the `Car` and `Employee` classes by creating an employee with a car and starting/stopping the car.



### Homework №4 Inheritance in Java
This part of the course explores the use of abstract classes and interfaces to create a simple animal classification system in Java. The code is organized into different packages and classes, each showcasing a different approach:

- **AbstractClass Package:** Demonstrates the use of abstract classes for animal classification. The `Main` class creates instances of dogs and cats, calculates the distance they can run and swim, and counts the total number of dogs and cats.

- **Interface Package:** Shows the use of interfaces for animal classification. The `Main` class creates instances of dogs and cats, calculates the distance they can run and swim, and counts the total number of dogs and cats.

- **Dog and Cat Classes:** Both the abstract and interface-based approaches have separate `Dog` and `Cat` classes, each implementing the respective behavior for running and swimming based on their type.

- **Animals Abstract Class and Interface:** Defines the common structure and behavior for animals using an abstract class (`Animals`) and an interface (`Animals`). This includes properties like name, breed, and age, as well as methods for running and swimming.

The `Main` class in each package demonstrates how these classes and interfaces are used to create and manage animal instances.

### Homework №5 Polymorphism in Java
In this part of the course, we explore polymorphism in Java. The program simulates a competition between participants and obstacles.

- **Figures Package:** Demonstrates the use of interfaces to create different shapes, such as circles, squares, and triangles. These shapes calculate their respective areas and are stored in an array. The `Main` class calculates the total area of all shapes.

- **Obstacle Package:** Introduces the concept of obstacles, such as running tracks and walls. These obstacles can be overcome by participants.

- **Participant Package:** Defines different types of participants: `Person`, `Cat`, and `Robot`. Each participant has maximum running and jumping abilities.

- **Main Class:** Combines participants and obstacles to simulate a competition. It calculates the success of each participant in overcoming obstacles and provides feedback based on their performance.

### Homework №6 Primitive and reference data types
- **printThreeWords():** A function that prints three words on the console: "Orange," "Banana," and "Apple."

- **checkSumSign():** A function that checks the sign of the sum of two numbers and prints an appropriate message.

- **printColor():** A function that prints a color status based on a given numeric value.

- **compareNumbers():** A function that compares two numbers and prints the comparison result.

- **isSumInRange(int num1, int num2):** A function that checks if the sum of two numbers is in the range from 10 to 20 (inclusive).

- **checkNumber(int num):** A function that checks if a number is positive or negative and prints the appropriate message.

- **isNegativeNum(int num):** A function that checks if a number is negative.

- **printStringMultipleTimes(String text, int count):** A function that prints a given string a specified number of times.

- **isLeapYear(int year):** A function that checks if a year is a leap year based on specified conditions.
